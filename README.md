# Smart Pea Sprout Farm
Grade 11 High school project. Creat the working prototype of the smart farming system using IoT based on ESP8266 NodeMCU Microcontroller and NETPIE server.

# Notice >> School project. Maintained by TinLethax. 

All of source code, schematics are created / maintained by TinLethax 

# Aiming

To create the working prototype of smart farming system that cost effective and can be developed in the future. We test with the Pea sprout or Pea seedling because it grows instantly. The hardware side We run the system on the popular NodeMCU ESP8266 development embeded board, By running in environment monitoring and wireless remote access through internet by using NETPIE as the server. On software side we coding on the Arduino platform because it easy and time saving.

# Principle of "How we make it works ?"

We use Microgear library to make the ESP8266 interfacing with the NETPIE server through Internet. and we use several sensors (We use Capacitive soil moisture sensor and DS18B20 to gather the environment data in form of temperature and humidity in analog value). On NETPIE web interface is capable of graph, gauge, toggle switch and more. SO we can use these feature to monitor / control our smart farming sensor.

# Current status of the project

We are working on the project paper along with the first prototype On-Breadboard circuit.
